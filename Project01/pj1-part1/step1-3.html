<p>It had all started with 9/11.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in T&nbsp;o&nbsp;r&nbsp;o&nbsp;n&nbsp;t&nbsp;o, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit.
  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the W&nbsp;o&nbsp;r&nbsp;l&nbsp;d Trade Center.
  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across b&nbsp;l&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;g&nbsp;&nbsp;s.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, using Notepad on W&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;w&nbsp;&nbsp;s, I started experimenting.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger’s publishing p&nbsp;l&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;f&nbsp;o&nbsp;r&nbsp;m before Google bought it.</p>

<p>Then, on November 5, 2001, I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That sparked something that was later called a blogging r&nbsp;e&nbsp;v&nbsp;o&nbsp;l&nbsp;u&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;o&nbsp;n: Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.</p>

    <p>Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in P&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;r&nbsp;s&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;n and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s why they called me “the b&nbsp;l&nbsp;o&nbsp;g&nbsp;f&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;h&nbsp;e&nbsp;r” in my mid-twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.</p>

    <p>Every morning, from my small apartment in downtown Toronto, I opened my c&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;m&nbsp;p&nbsp;&nbsp;u&nbsp;t&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;r and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a diverse crowd — from exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local j&nbsp;o&nbsp;u&nbsp;r&nbsp;n&nbsp;a&nbsp;l&nbsp;i&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;s, politicians, clerics, and war veterans — and I always encouraged even more.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to j&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;n and start writing.</p>

    <p>The breadth of what was available those days amazed us all. It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d left Iran in late 2000 to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging t&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;s at home.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But reading Iranian blogs in Toronto was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers.</p>
