<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;t had all started with 9&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;1.
   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a v&nbsp;i&nbsp;s&nbsp;i&nbsp;t.
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W&nbsp;e were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade C&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;t&nbsp;e&nbsp;r.
   <br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across b&nbsp;l&nbsp;o&nbsp;g&nbsp;s.
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;n&nbsp;c&nbsp;e I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as w&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;l.
   <br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting.
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;o&nbsp;o&nbsp;n I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger’s publishing platform before Google bought i&nbsp;t.</p>

<p><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;h&nbsp;e&nbsp;n, on November 5, 2001, I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a b&nbsp;l&nbsp;o&nbsp;g.
  <br>&nbsp;T&nbsp;h&nbsp;a&nbsp;t sparked something that was later called a blogging r&nbsp;e&nbsp;v&nbsp;o&nbsp;l&nbsp;u&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;o&nbsp;n:
  <br>&nbsp;S&nbsp;o&nbsp;o&nbsp;n, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of w&nbsp;r&nbsp;i&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;n&nbsp;g.</p>

<p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;h&nbsp;o&nbsp;s&nbsp;e days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the l&nbsp;i&nbsp;s&nbsp;&nbsp;t.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;h&nbsp;a&nbsp;t’s why they called me “the blogfather” in my mid-twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I c&nbsp;a&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;d.</p>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&nbsp;v&nbsp;e&nbsp;r&nbsp;y morning, from my small apartment in downtown Toronto, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and a&nbsp;u&nbsp;d&nbsp;i&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;c&nbsp;e.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;t was a diverse crowd — from exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans — and I always encouraged even m&nbsp;o&nbsp;r&nbsp;e.
       <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and start w&nbsp;r&nbsp;i&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;n&nbsp;g.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;h&nbsp;e breadth of what was available those days amazed us all. It was partly why I promoted blogging so s&nbsp;e&nbsp;r&nbsp;i&nbsp;o&nbsp;u&nbsp;s&nbsp;l&nbsp;y.
      <br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;’&nbsp;d left Iran in late 2000 to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at h&nbsp;o&nbsp;m&nbsp;e.
       <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;u&nbsp;t reading Iranian blogs in Toronto was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random p&nbsp;a&nbsp;s&nbsp;s&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;g&nbsp;e&nbsp;r&nbsp;s.</p>
