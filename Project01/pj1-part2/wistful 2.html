  It had all started with 9/11.
</font>
  <br><br><font size="3" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit.</font>
  <br> <font size="4" face="arial" color="#3a3a3a">We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center.</font>
   <br><font size="2" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs.
   <br>Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well.</font>
   <br><font size="3" face="arial" color="#3a3a3a">So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting.
  <br> Soon I ended up writing on </font><font size="5" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">hoder.com</font> <font size="3" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">using Blogger’s publishing platform before Google bought it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="arial" color="#3a3a3a">Then, on November 5, 2001, I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog.</font>
   <br><font size="4" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution: Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="arial" color="#3a3a3a">Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list.</font>
      <br> <font size="4" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">That’s why they called me “the blogfather” in my mid-twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="arial" color="#3a3a3a">Every morning, from my small apartment in downtown Toronto, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience.</font>
    <br><font size="5" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">It was a diverse crowd </font><font size="4" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">— from exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans — </font><font size="2" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">and I always encouraged even more.</font>
    <br><font size="3" face="arial" color="#3a3a3a">I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and start writing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">The breadth of what was available those days amazed us all. It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously.</font>
    <br><font size="3" face="arial" color="#3a3a3a">  I’d left Iran in late 2000 to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home.</font>
      <br><font size="4" face="arial" color="#6b6b6b">But reading Iranian blogs in Toronto was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers.</font></p>
