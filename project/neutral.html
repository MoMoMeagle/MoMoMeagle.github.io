   <p>
   I was in <em>Toronto</em>, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit.
  We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center.
   I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs.
   Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well.
  So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting.
  Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger’s publishing platform before Google bought it.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>Then, on <em class=color>November 5, 2001</em>, I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog.
  That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution: Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top <em class=color>5</em> nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in <em>Persian</em> and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list.
      That’s why they called me “the blogfather” in my mid-twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>Every morning, from my small apartment in downtown <em>Toronto</em>, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience.
      It was a diverse crowd — from exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans — and I always encouraged even more.
       I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and start writing.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>The breadth of what was available those days amazed us all. It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously.
      I’d left Iran in late <em class=color>2000</em> to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home.
       But reading Iranian blogs in <em>Toronto</em> was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers.</p>
